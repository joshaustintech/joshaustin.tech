# Summary
I'm a dedicated JVM backend developer with an obsession for delivering quality and value.

I rebooted my career in 2018 after a stint in the non-profit space. Since then, I have worked in consulting, grocery delivery, and global supply chain.

My work since 2018 has been primarily building with Spring Boot to connect with databases (SQL & NoSQL), REST APIs, and/or Kafka. I write code that is resilient, scalable, and reduces technical debt. Most importantly, I like to obsess over the customer experience and make sure that I'm delivering what the customer needs.

Some of my code has very high business impact, including value multipliers because they bring significant recurring revenue. I have also secured significant revenue by providing mission-critical support during emergencies.

Additional technical skills include:
- **Software Architecture** (Monoliths, Microservices, Moduliths)
- **Containers** (Docker, Docker Compose)
- **Cloud** (AWS EC2, AWS Lambda, Google Cloud)
- **Unit and Integration Testing** (JUnit, Spock, TestNG)
- **Software Supply Chain** (Maven, Gradle, Artifactory)
- **Security** (OWASP, Spring Security)
- **Alternative JVM Languages** (Kotlin, Groovy, Jython)
- **Frontend Development** (TypeScript, React, jQuery)
- **Web Solutions Engineering** (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- **Content Manager Development** (WordPress, Hugo)
- **Code Repositories** (GitHub, BitBucket, GitLab)
- **CI/CD** (Jenkins, GitHub Actions)
- **Design Patterns**
- **Best Practices**
- **Blockchain**
