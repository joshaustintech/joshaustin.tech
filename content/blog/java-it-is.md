I was really pumped to cover a lot of developer topics this year. After a month and a half of trying to squeeze everything together, I've come to the realization I simply don't have the time to learn and build everything I want to. And that's OK.

An older friend who retired comfortably from the spoils of the .COM Era shared some simple yet profound bits of advice this week when I asked him what was his recipe for success:

> Focus on what you know best.

For me, that would definitely be Java.

> Ask God "how can I make my family's life better?"

So far, for my situation, it's definitely sticking with Java. In my current situation, the majority of the highest-paying jobs are in Java.

Around the same time I encountered [DHH's article on investing in things that don't change](https://world.hey.com/dhh/invest-in-things-that-don-t-change-6f7f19e1). Java is definitely still very familiar even if you haven't touched it in 10 years.

That doesn't mean I'll stop exploring other things, like Rust, but I need to deliberately spend less time on those other things so I can sharpen the strongest skill I have.

I've started working on my first RIFE2 project, and I've started reading a book on the Java game engine FXGL. These should keep me preoccupied in between my explorations of Rust.
