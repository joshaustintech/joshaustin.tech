# Introduction
In this post I collect some thoughts and then create checkbox goals. If I complete them by the end of the
year I'll come back and check them off.

# Year of the UI
I've been spending most the last 5 years on backend development. Mainly building APIs to record, update,
or delete data. This year I really want to build some useful UIs that elevate the user experience in
some way. I want to focus first on the tablet form factor, for which Apple still has a stranglehold on
the market. Towards this purpose I am learning SwiftUI. Swift is an underrated language. Other programming
languages could benefit from features such as `guard let`.

- [ ] First goal: Publish an iPad app to the App Store.

# Semi-Permanent Problem Solving with Rust
For the last year or so I have become enamored with the Rust Programming Language. While I have found
some elements of the Rust community to be toxic and judgmental, the resources and friendly tutorials
abound.

I'm a busy and tired family man. I want to solve problems and not need to come back to the solution
every few months unless the scope of the problem itself has changed. I am under the impression that
Rust lends itself very well to being low maintenance once a project is done.

[I wrote a sphere raytracer in Rust last year](/blog/raytracer-what-i-learned) and learned a lot along
the way. The next category of topics I need to understand in Rust is Asynchrony.

- [ ] Second goal: Read the book *Rust Atomics and Locks*.
- [ ] Third goal: Solve a real-world problem in Rust, observe how long it takes before it needs updates.

# Demonstrate Professional Effort
My current work as a consultant is under a heavy NDA. Consequently, it is hard to demonstrate my accomplishments
with my clients when they happen. A certification would be an excellent way to demonstrate the effort I have
put into continuously growing my skills.

- [ ] Fourth goal: Earn at least one technical certification this year.
