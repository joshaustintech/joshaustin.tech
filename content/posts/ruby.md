## Background

{{< youtube qObzgUfCl28 >}}

# 

My first tech stack was nicknamed the "LAPP Stack", using Linux, Apache, Postgres instead
of MySQL, and vanilla PHP (no Laravel, no CodeIgniter, etc.). At the time, I thought it
was a superior tech stack and would make fun of Ruby. Mostly to tease the college
classmates who I perceived to be "fanboys".

During then, and again in 2024, I had some low-key curiosity around the Ruby programming
language and picked up a copy of
[the pickaxe book](https://pragprog.com/titles/ruby5/programming-ruby-3-3-5th-edition/).

## My first project

In 2025, I had the privilege to learn [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) while on
the job to support a team struggling with headcount. THis came after working using almost
exclusively Java and Kotlin paired with [Spring](https://spring.io/) and many variations
of SQL databases (and some Kafka) since late 2018.

Having all the tools I needed out of the box was simultaneously refreshing and a little
intimidating! Thankfully, I had a great team lead that showed me the ropes and set me on
the path to delivering small production-ready features for
[BzzAgent](https://bzzagent.com/), a site serving over 1M users and bringing in a reported
revenue of $22.4M in 2025.

After 6 months, it was time to return to working with Spring again, but something changed
for me. Working with an entire system as a whole from a single Git repo was a welcome
change from working on a galaxy of microservices and not-so-micro services. Like Spring,
there were typically built-in functions and patterns for the majority of easily solved
problems. Unlike Spring, the features I need the most come out of the box: webpages,
APIs, DB migrations, queues, testing, and more!

## Living in the Pax Railsana

{{< youtube gcwzWzC7gUA >}}

#

As Rails developers enjoy a rejuvenating era in the ecosystem that DHH has dubbed the
*Pax Railsana*, I've grown to appreciate the friendly communities surrounding both the
Ruby language by itself and the Ruby on Rails framework, which remains their
["killer app"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killer_application) though by no means the
only reason to use Ruby.

The common thread from watching RailsWorld 2025 on YouTube and attending XORuby's Chicago
event in the same year has increased my appetite for the value of building systems with
deliberately compressed complexity as a design choice. Since then, I've grown more
involved with [ChicagoRuby](https://chicagoruby.org/) and have become a co-organizer as
of this week.

## Conclusion

This is a great time to be a Ruby developer. I'm looking forward to getting deeper into
Ruby on Rails on my spare time, watching people solve problems, helping Rails teams find
vetted engineers, and supporting everyone who is making Ruby a great tool for compressing
complexities of all sorts.
