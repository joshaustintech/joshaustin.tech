I largely agree with this and wanted to add some nuance. I would say that it should be that seniors *code* less, since thinking more and bringing value to the team is still hard work that should be rewarded.

Unfortunately, I have encountered a VP of Engineering once upon a time who did not understand this and complained about the senior engineer's lack of code commits. The senior engineer's time was filled with valuable code review, design research and review, and mentoring others.

When the layoffs came the senior developer was let go.

There is a *big* difference between performance and value, and the company was (probably still is) too na√Øve to realize they had removed one of their most valuable assets.

Don't make this rookie-level mistake if you are in leadership and observe less code coming from senior engineers.
